How to I escape?

You need to run as fast as you can through a series of levels.

What are the controls? I don't know how to move.

You use the arrows or WASD (Not implemented yet!) to move arround and Z to jump.

You also can use a controller to play. Left stick to move and A (Xbox), B (Nintendo) or X (DualShock)

What do people think about the game?

"Fast and hard, a game in the style of Super Meat Boy"  
"Fun to play"

The final version is going to have 16 levels and hopefully procedurally-generated levels.

Game is still on early development, so expect bugs, parts of the levels that you can skip and more.
